# TACHY-Examples
Examples of various AI solutions using Tachy-Shield Edge AI Board

## Infrence Modes
This repository provides two types of inference examples:

- #### Host-driven Inference
  In this mode, a Raspberry Pi (or another host device) sends inference requests to the Tachy-Shield Edge AI Board, which performs the actual inference as an accelerator.


- #### Standalone Inference
  In this mode, the Tachy-Shield Edge AI Board performs the entire inference process independently, without requiring a host device.

## Getting Started

### Host-driven Inference
For detailed instructions, please see the [Host-driven Inference README](./host_inference_examples/README.md).


### Standalone Inference
For detailed instructions, please see the [Standalone Inference README](./standalone_inference_examples/README.md).
